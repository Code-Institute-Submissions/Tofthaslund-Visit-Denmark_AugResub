## Description


This project is creacted to showcase Denmark as a tourist destination.
The goal with this website is to attract tourist by showing the different cities to
visit and also show a handful of the most visited tourist attractions in Denmark.
The tourist attractions are showcased with the help of Google Maps API with pin dropped 
over each location, whit the help of Javascript.
Javascript has also been used to create foldable content menues, so visities of the website can
see the admission price each place.
Lastly Javascript and a API from exchangerate-api.com has been used to create a currency convertor 
for tourist to see admission fees in their local currency.
The website is made responsive with Bootstrap and CSS.
