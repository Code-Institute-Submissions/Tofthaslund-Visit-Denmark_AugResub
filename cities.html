                    <h3>Copenhagen</h3>
                    <p>
                        Copenhagen is a popular city when it comes to hosting congresses and conventions; consistently
                        ranking among the world's top ten. Within 20 minutes of the city centre, and close to the
                        Øresund Bridge to Sweden, lies Scandinavia's largest showcase. The Bella Convention & Exhibition
                        Centre covers 122,000 square metres and has a capacity of 20,000 concurrent congress
                        participants. In terms of smaller scale gatherings, most hotels in Copenhagen and Malmo offer
                        ample facilities to cater to larger meetings, events and conferences. The family owned hotel
                        chain Arp-Hansen has a Copenhagen Downtown Congress Centre that opened in the fall of 2010.
                        Copenhagen is known for its low crime rate, its general efficiency and the high standard of its
                        cultural and entertainment attractions.
                        Copenhagen is one of Europe's finest shopping destinations and has become a first class gourmet
                        experience, with Michelin star restaurants, and Noma that was voted the worlds' best restaurant
                        in 2010. The city's main shopping area is centred on the longest pedestrian street in Europe,
                        Strøget, and the charming 17th century streets surrounding it. Apart from Magasin du Nord, the
                        biggest department store in Scandinavia, Copenhagen boasts hundreds of boutiques, restaurants,
                        and cafés. Danish design items such as Bang and Olufsen stereos, Royal Copenhagen porcelain and
                        Georg Jensen silverware, are world famous. All have flagship stores in Copenhagen.
                        Denmark is renowned for the high standard of living they offer their inhabitants. In their
                        latest survey into the standard of living in the world's cities, the renowned consultancy firm
                        William M. Mercer positioned Copenhagen as number five in its 'Best Cities' list. Monocle
                        Magazine placed Copenhagen as nr.1 and as nr.2 on its top twenty list of most liveable cities,
                        citing its excellent transport, quality housing, superb shopping, and abundant culture among the
                        reasons they'd like to live here. They could also have mentioned that the inflation rate in
                        Denmark has been one of the lowest in Europe for many years and that the economy remains strong.
                        Tourism is an important source of foreign currency and employment.

                    <h3>Roskilde</h3>
                    <p>
                        Roskilde, city, eastern Zealand (Sjælland), Denmark, at the head of Roskilde Fjord. It is named
                        for its legendary founder, Hroar (Ro), and the sacred springs (kilde), several of which remain
                        nearby. The former seat of Danish kings (c. 1020–1416) and capital of Denmark (until 1443), it
                        has been a bishopric since about 1060 and was Denmark’s most important ecclesiastical centre
                        until the Reformation. The Treaty of Roskilde with Sweden was drafted there in 1658.
                        Roskilde is the largest rail junction and traffic centre on Zealand, and its development has
                        been stimulated by proximity to Copenhagen (with which it was connected by the first Danish
                        railway in 1847). Roskilde also lies on the major rail and road connections that link Sweden
                        with Germany via the bridge and tunnel systems across the Great Belt (1997–98) and The Sound
                        (2000). The city hosts several institutions of higher learning and research, including Roskilde
                        University (1972) and Risø National Laboratory (1958), and many of Roskilde’s traditional
                        industries have now been replaced by more research-oriented business.
                        The city’s partly Romanesque, partly Gothic cathedral was begun by the bishop (later archbishop)
                        Absalon about 1170 (consecrated 1464) on the site of two earlier churches. The cathedral is the
                        royal mausoleum where 38 Danish kings and queens are buried, including 16 in an unbroken line
                        from the Reformation to 1972. A museum of Viking relics, including 1,000-year-old longboats,
                        opened in 1969. Pop. (2008 est.) city, 45,824; (2005 est.) mun., 79,441.

                    <h3>Aarhus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Århus, also spelled Aarhus, city, eastern Jutland, Denmark. It lies along Århus Bay and has an
                        extensive harbour. Its origin is unknown, although traces of a Viking settlement have been found
                        near the outflow of the now-covered Århus stream. The oldest existing charter for the town
                        (1441) refers to a still-earlier charter. Århus became a bishopric in 948 and prospered during
                        the European Middle Ages, having many religious institutions at that time, but the city declined
                        after the Reformation. Beginning in the 19th century, industrialization, the extension of the
                        Danish railway system, and the expansion of its harbour stimulated the city’s growth to the
                        point that Århus is now Jutland’s foremost city and the second largest city in Denmark. It is a
                        busy port and is the centre of commerce and industry in Jutland. Århus’ manufactures include
                        metals, chemicals, machinery, beer, and tobacco products, and there are shipbuilding
                        facilities.Many old buildings can be found in the Old Town section of the city. Medieval
                        landmarks include the 11th-century crypt of St. Nicholas under the Church of Our Lady and the
                        13th-century Århus Cathedral dedicated to St. Clement, which has a 312-foot- (95-metre-) high
                        tower and is the longest church (305 feet [93 m]) in Denmark. It was built in the Flamboyant
                        Gothic style. The town hall (1938–42) and the university buildings (1933–46) are examples of
                        early 20th-century Danish architecture. The Århus Art Museum (1858) includes a display of runic
                        stones, and Den Gamle By is a unique open-air museum (1909) of an early Danish town. The Viking
                        Museum contains exhibits of Viking artifacts. In addition to Aarhus University (opened 1928),
                        there are several specialized colleges and an academy of music in the city. The city’s main
                        concert hall, Musikhuset Aarhus (1982), hosts opera and symphony concerts. Pop. (2008 est.)

                        Skagen, also called The Skaw, city and port, northern Jutland, Denmark, near the northern tip of
                        the peninsula on the Kattegat strait. Chartered in 1413, it is one of the principal fishing
                        centres in Denmark. It is also a summer resort and, from the 1870s, the site of an artists’ and
                        writers’ colony. Notable are the Råbjerg Mile sand dunes to the south and the Old Church, which
                        has been buried to the roof in sand since a storm in 1775. At the Grenen headland, the most
